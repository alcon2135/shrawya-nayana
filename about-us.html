                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrawya Nayana 3.0</span> is the third consecutive edition of our signature project by the Rotaract Club of CINEC Campus, focused
                    on supporting individuals with hearing and vision impairments. In Phase 1, we visited the Sri
                    Chandrasekara Deaf School in Moratuwa, where we conducted an art and origami workshop, donated essential
                    supplies, and helped set up a learning aid room. The project aims to empower differently-abled
                    individuals through creativity, education, and sustainable support.

              <p class="section4-text">
                In Phase 2 of Shrawya Nayana 3.0 we focus on creating and donating audiobooks for visually impaired
                individuals. These audiobooks support both educational and recreational needs, making learning more
                accessible and engaging. The phase promotes inclusive education and provides long-term resources to
                empower their academic journey.
